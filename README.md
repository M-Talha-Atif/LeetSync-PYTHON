# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Grind

Welcome to my LeetCode journey! This repository auto-updates with solutions I solve every day — thanks to a custom extension that syncs my progress.

## 🧩 Patterns Covered

Focus on mastering common LeetCode patterns — these are the building blocks of efficient problem solving:

- **Two Pointers** – fast & slow pointer tricks for arrays & linked lists  
- **Sliding Window** – dynamic range-based approaches  
- **Binary Search** – divide-and-conquer on sorted structures  
- **Backtracking** – recursive search with pruning  
- **Dynamic Programming** – subproblem optimization  
- **Graph Traversal** – BFS, DFS, and union-find problems  
- **Lovely Pattern: Heap Based** – priority queues for greedy decisions  
- **Linked List Challenges** – pointer manipulation and classic DS problems

## 🛠️ Languages Used

I solve problems primarily using:

- **Java** – for clean OOP structure and speed  
- **Kotlin** – expressive and concise syntax  
- **Python** – quick prototyping and algorithm clarity

## 🚀 Auto-Syncing

Solutions are automatically pushed here via an extension I built — minimal friction, maximum consistency.
